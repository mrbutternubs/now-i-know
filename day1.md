# Now I Know...

A living record of things I'm learning as I grow into a developer and creator.

### 🧠 How Git Works (Simplified)

- `git add .` stages all changes in the current directory (and subdirectories).
- `git commit -m "message"` saves a snapshot of the staged changes.
- `git push` uploads the committed changes to GitHub.

I learned that you **must commit before you push** — pushing without committing won't send any changes to GitHub.

### 🌐 HTML + CSS Linking

I learned that the file names don’t have to be `index.html` or `style.css` — what matters is that the `href` in `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">` matches the actual file name and path.

### 🧪 GitHub Pages Debug Tip

If your site shows a **blank white screen**, check:
- That your HTML is named `index.html` (GitHub Pages needs this)
- That all files are pushed and committed properly
- That your CSS is correctly linked

Seeing it work in VS Code doesn’t always mean it’s live — it needs to be deployed properly too.

## 🧠 What `code .` Does

Today I learned about the `code .` command.

- `code` is a command-line shortcut to open **Visual Studio Code** from the terminal.
- The `.` means "current directory."
- So when I run:

  code .
  
It opens the folder I'm currently in — right in VS Code!
